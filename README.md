Python experiment using voice and face recognition

This is a small example of a fake chat-bot (In that it cannot respond to anything meaningful).  It was designed as a gag to run on a Raspberry Pi and be silly.

This was mostly a learning experiment to pay with different capabilities:
1) wake-words using snowboy
2) using a camera in python and face recognition using OpenCV
3) text-to-speech using Flite
4) efficient use of 2d graphics in pygame
